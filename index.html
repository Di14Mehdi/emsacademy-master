  <h1>What is it that we do?</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Our programs are meant for kids from age 6 to 18, who are dedicated on achieving high results in the classroom as well as in the court or the field.
    Our coaches are here to help you or your kid improve their skills and develop a great work ethic. Tutors are also available to help students with their homework and support their school learning.

<div style="padding: 0px 15% 35px 15%;font-size:30px; line-height: 1.5; text-align:left;">
  <br>
  <p>Basketball is a great sport to develop good motor skills and hand-eye coordination. But one of the most important value of this sport is teamwork and competitivity.
  <br>We believe that involving young kids with basketball will help them not only develop physically but also psychologically.
  <br>With our one on one, as with our small group workouts, we help assess the strengths and weaknesses of the player to help to improve them.

  <br>
  <p>Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. Apart from being a fun sport to play outdoor, the benefits that it has on the body are many.
    <br>Physically, soccer is high cardio sport that strengthens core muscles and motor skills. It is a sport that we believe to help sustain an active and healthy lifestyle.
    Just as any other team sport, soccer helps in the development of social and leadership skills that are very important in one's self development.
